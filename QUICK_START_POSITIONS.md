### 4️⃣ **1-DAY TIMEFRAME** (Long-term Trading)

```
RECOMMENDATION: 🟠 WEAK SELL
Score: -3/20 | Confidence: MEDIUM

🎯 SETUP (Short):
Entry:  $103,107

```

**📊 WHY THIS POSITION:**

**Technical Indicators:**

3. ❌ MACD deeply negative
4. ❌ ADX 46 (strong downtrend)
5. ✅✅✅ BUT: EXTREME FEAR might signal bottom
6. ⚠️ Conflict: Technicals bearish, sentiment bullish

**💡 TRADE IDEA:**
**CONFLICTING SIGNALS!**

**For SHORT-TERM traders:** SELL (technicals bearish)
**For LONG-TERM investors:** ACCUMULATE (extreme fear = bottom)

**Recommended Strategy:**
- Don't short against extreme fear
- Don't go all-in on longs with bearish daily
- **BEST APPROACH:** DCA (Dollar Cost Averaging)
- Buy small amounts weekly/monthly
- This is accumulation zone, not trading zone

- Fear & Greed: Extreme Fear (15)
- **Historical data:** 75% of extreme fear readings mark bottoms

**Best Strategy:**
1. Don't fight the daily trend (bearish)
2. Don't ignore extreme fear (bullish contrarian)
3. Solution: DCA small amounts
4. Average in over 4-8 weeks
5. Long-term, this is likely a good zone
